Ready for the answers? Let's walk through the answers, step by step.

The first step is to define the function, using the syntax we covered in the last couple videos. It should look like this: 

def uppercase_and_reverse(text):
Now, we need to actually build functionality (see what I did there?) inside of the function. Specifically we need to uppercase and reverse the text. The uppercasing is pretty straightforward: 

def uppercase_and_reverse(text):
    uppercase_text = text.upper()
.upper() takes care of that. But the reversing is a little trickier. 

def uppercase_and_reverse(text):
    uppercase_text = text.upper()
    reverse_and_uppercase_text = uppercase_text[::-1]
    return reverse_and_uppercase_text
This solution gets you there, but it's a little long. There's actually a simpler way to accomplish the same reversal. We can combine lines 33 and 34. Like so:

def uppercase_and_reverse(text):
    uppercase_text = text.upper()
    return uppercase_text[::-1]
We can also run both parts of this function on the same line. This is called chaining. 

def uppercase_and_reverse(text):
    return text.upper()[::-1]
This is a very simple, clean way of running the function. You can reverse the order, it's simply chained together. 

And remember, if we were to define a function reverse(text) like this: 

def uppercase_and_reverse(text):
    return reverse(text.upper())
    
def reverse(text):
    return text [::-1]

print(uppercase_and_reverse("banana")) # ANANAB
It doesn't matter that it comes after our function uppercase_and_reverse(text). The only thing that matters is that it exist before its called to do anything on line 37. But it's a good idea to keep things in order.
