Flask is a Python framework that you can use to build full-stack web applications. In the next few lessons, I'll take you through the process of building out both the front-end and back-end with Python.

What is Flask?
Flask is a light-weight framework with a built-in server that will allow us to turn our Python scripts into webpages and web apps. To say that another way, Flask allows us to make websites with Python. 

Let's see if Flask is installed
If you used Anaconda to install Python (as we did at the beginning of this course) then you should have Flask installed already. 

To find out if you have flask type the following command on the command line: 

$ Flask 
If the text that appears says something like "A general utility script for Flask applications" and "Options" then you are good to go!

But if you see "command not found?" then you'll want to visit Flask and install Flask by running the command pip install flask. 

Let's run our Flask server 
Find the starter code on the Flask homepage. Paste that code into a new file called web.py.

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"
Run the server with the command 
This command will run your Python script and more or less turn your command line application into a server.

$ FLASK_APP=hello.py flask run
To quit the server you'll need to press control-Z.
