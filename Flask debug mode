Make life easier on yourself with debug mode 
Every time you make a change in you're Python code, you'll have quit, and restart the server. Annoying right? Run this export FLASK_ENV command and your Python code will update in real-time, without having to restart: 

$ export FLASK_ENV=development
If for some reason that didn't work, try adding these two lines to the bottom of your file: 

if __name__=="_main_":
    app.run(debug=True)
Note: The first time you add this code you'll need to shut down the Flask server and restart it.
