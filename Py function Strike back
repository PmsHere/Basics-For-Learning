Function checklist
Function definitions begin with def
A function name can only contain characters or an _ (underscore)
Open parenthesis ( right after function name
Arguments are separated by commas
Each argument must be unique (no duplicate names)
Close parenthesis and use colon ): 
Indent all lines of code in the function with a tab (required)
End function by de-indenting back to the same indent level as the def
Too many or too few function arguments
If you add too many or too few arguments into a function:

...
print_two(first_name, 28, "Oops")
...
And try to run the file, you'll get an error:

$ python functions.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "functions.py", line 16, in <module>
    print_two(first_name, 28, "Oops")
TypeError: print_two() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
Now, you can change the argument order in a function. It's pretty common and convenient. 

print(concatenate(word_two='Mattan', word_one='Griffel'))
Everything that happens inside of a function is isolated from what happens outside a function. This is called scoping.
